# Darudify

Ever felt like your terminal was being a bit too quiet?

Love hearing awesome hacked up applescript covers of your favourite EDM song?

Boy are you in luck!

P.s Yes I did just spend an hour learning applescript and then piecing together this horrible method of playing the tune so please, show some love.

##Usage
Download and run "\<location\>/.darudify" for fun.

"\<location\>/.fancydarudify" for colourful fun. (See requirements).

###Requirements
OSX - sound plays through a gross applescript.

toilet - fancydarudify also outputs colourful text and therefore requires toilet!

###Tips
Copy to someones machine and run in background using "nohup ./darudify.sh &"

For extra evilness, append to their .bashrc! "cat darudify.sh >> ~/.bashrc"
